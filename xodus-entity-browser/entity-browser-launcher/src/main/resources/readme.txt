How to run:

    * execute script run.bat or run.sh
    * open browser http://localhost:8080 (Jetty server binds to all interfaces on port 8080 therefore all interfaces can be
        used to access application)


Hot to configure
    * to change JVM arguments and server port feel free to modify startup scripts.
