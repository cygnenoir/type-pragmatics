==================

(updated 27.03.)
* implement concrete provers/transformers/verifiers from existing code in benchmark/backend (André?)
* update UML diagram (new ProofGraph API), ER Diagram (ProofGraphXodus implementation)
* experiment with version histories & Xodus
* how to check proofs from ATPs (TPTP/TSTP)? Is there a tool? (GDV,
