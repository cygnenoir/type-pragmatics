## EProver Installation ##

Either download one of the binaries available at http://wwwlehre.dhbw-stuttgart.de/~sschulz/E/Download.html, or build a binary yourself. A simple ./configure; make is enough, the binary is found at PROVER/eprover thereafter.
Make sure this binary is available for benchmarks by either pointing your PATH variable to it or move it to a visible directory.
